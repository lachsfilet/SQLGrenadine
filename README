SQL Grenadine is REally Neither A Database Interface Nor an Editor

SQLGrenadine will be an SQL database management tool, written in Mono C# with a
GUI realized with GTK#.

The goal is to develop a platform, which will be capable to connect to any
database the user wants, via System.Data interface and a plugin structure for
the specific database dll's, connection and management stuff.
